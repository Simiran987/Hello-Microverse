# Hello-Microverse Project 👋🏻


> Microverse provides the path to learn. Thus, this project also provided me the opportunity to learn using linters, GitHub Flow rules and documenting my work. 
   I used GitHub Actions, Lighthouse, Webhint and Stylelint to make this project error-free. Also, all the other files except the HTML and CSS files were added to feature branches to make the main branch remain in best possible condition and stable. I have tried to commit clear and understandable messages as well.
